# SimpleOpinionMining
Simple Opinion Mining solution Develped for my Honours Project

This project was made to allow a better understanding of how Opinion mining works and an easy way to implement for undergraduates. 

This code was completed as my Honours project in 2017, While researching Opinion mining I saw that there was a lack of projects that show an 
easy method that could be used to implement some sort of simple opinion mining features within programs. 
I have realeased the code publicly as I believe it will help students that want to learn more about Opinion mining but do not know where to 
look or where to start when developing their code.

This code was implemented and used in a Android application that allowed users to search and rate their Local Doctors, hence it was easiest
to code in Java.
